## Programming Root

Root robots can programed using the companion **SAM Root** app available on [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sam-root/id1524652548), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rootrobotics.rootcoding), or [Web](https://root.samlabs.com/).

![Three coding levels](images/root-coding-levels.png)

Advanced users can also use the [iRobot Education Python Web Playground](https://python.irobot.com/) or downloadable [iRobot Education Python 3 SDK](https://github.com/iRobotEducation/irobot-edu-python-sdk) for even more control over the robots.

## Turning Root On/Off

To turn the Root robot on or off, press and hold the yellow button (otherwise referred to as its “nose”) until the lights turn on/off (around 4 seconds).

![Turning Root on illustration](images/root-turn-on.png)

If Root is not responding as expected, hold the power button for 10 seconds to force the Root robot to turn off.

> [!TIP]
> The yellow nose button also acts as a "stop" button.
> Pressing it while a program is running will immediately stop the motors and tell the SAM Root app to stop the running project.

## Charging

To charge your Root robot, plug a powered USB cable into the USB-C port on the top of the robot.
For the quickest charging, we recommend using a USB charger capable of supplying 5W (5V, 1A) or greater.
We also recommend always using the USB cable supplied with the robot.

![Root charging illustration](images/root-charging.png)

While the robot is charging, a light on top of the robot will flash yellow.
Once the robot is fully charged, the light will stay green.
Please note that the robot is not able to connect over Bluetooth while it is charging.

For additional information about charging, refer to the [Product Information Guide](files/Root-Product-Info-Guide.pdf).

### Charging Contacts

The Root robot can also be charged by applying between 6.5V and 9V across the two metal charging contacts on the rear of the robot.
The robot has a special circuit to make the charging contacts reversible, so it does not matter which charging contact has the higher voltage.
However, please note that the USB-C port supports higher charging currents and typically results in faster charging.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not apply more than 9 Volts across the charging contacts.
> Excessive voltage can damage the robot.

## Bluetooth Connection

Root coding robots are controlled over a Bluetooth® Low Energy connection by a companion device, such as a laptop, tablet, phone, or Raspberry Pi.
Root robots are available to connect over Bluetooth whenever 
1. the robot is powered on (i.e. the eyes are on) 
2. it not connected to another device.

Once you connect to the robot, it will play a chime and the lights will briefly flash blue.
To disconnect, trigger a disconnection from the app or turn off the robot by holding down the yellow nose button.

To start, go to [root.samlabs.com](https://root.samlabs.com/) to use the SAM Root web app or download the SAM Root app from the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1524652548) or [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rootrobotics.rootcoding).
To connect to robots when using the [web app](https://root.samlabs.com/), you must use a browser that supports Web Bluetooth, such as [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge).
The SAM Root app features three coding levels (graphical, hybrid, and text) to support learners of all skill levels.
Once you have made a project, you can tap the robot connection button and select your robot to connect.
Then press the play button to see your project come to life!

![Root Bluetooth connection illustration](images/root-connect.png)

## Mechanical

Root is a differential drive robot with two driven wheels and four slide points to limit tipping.
When both wheels turn the same speed in the same direction, the robot will drive straight.
When the wheels turn different speeds, the robot will turn/arc.
When the wheels are the same speed in opposite directions, the robot will turn in place.
Each wheel uses encoders to maintain the correct speed and measure the distance traveled.
The maximum speed is 10 cm/s.

</details>

### Charging

<details>
<summary><b>What type of charger do Root® coding robots require?</b></summary>

For full charging speeds, Root® coding robots require a minimum 5W (5V, 1A) USB charger.
We recommend always using the charging cable provided with the robot.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How long do the Root® coding robots’ batteries last?</b></summary>

The Root® coding robots’ batteries will typically last for 2 hours of continuous, heavy-use, and 1 week with intermittent use.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How long do Root® coding robots take to charge?</b></summary>

The charging speed is dependent on the amount of current your USB adapter can provide. 
Adapters with 5W or more should charge at full speed and be and to charge completely (from empty to full) in under 3 hours.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How do I know that the Root® coding robots are fully charged?</b></summary>

When Root® coding robots are fully charged, the LED lights on the top of the robot will glow green.
You should unplug the charger when the battery is full.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Why isn’t my Root® coding robot charging?</b></summary>

The charging cable provided should always be used to charge your robot. If your Root® coding robot does not indicate that it is charging – even when using the provided charging cable and a minimum 5W USB adapter – the battery may be at too low of a voltage.

If this is the case, please follow the steps below: 
- Plug your robot in and wait 1 hour. (The robot should slowly charge even if it does not flash the LED lights.)
- After 1 hour, unplug the robot, then plug it back in again.
- If the LED light still does not light up, leave the robot plugged in and repeat these steps after an additional hour.

If your robot is still not charging after following the above instructions, please contact us. 

</details>

### Drawing

<details>
<summary><b>Do Root® coding robots require a special type of marker or pen?</b></summary>

Root® coding robots support a wide range of markers and pens, but not every brand or design will work.
To ensure proper operation, insert the marker when the holder is raised and leave a small gap between the surface and the tip of the marker.
For markers that are too narrow, you may try wrap some tape around the neck of the marker to widen the diameter until it can be held in place.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Why won’t my Root® Pro coding robot stick to my whiteboard?</b></summary>

**Only the Root® Pro coding robot (with the white top) is designed to attach to and navigate magnetic whiteboard surfaces.**
On some whiteboards with weak magnetic backing, the Root® Pro coding robot might slip.
Other whiteboards may not have any magnetic backing at all.
Root will also not stick to magnetic whiteboard paint.

Please note that you can still use a magnetic or non-magnetic whiteboard with either model of the Root® coding robot model as long as the whiteboard and robot are placed on a horizontal surface, such as a table or floor.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Why is my Root® Pro coding robot moving slowly and making additional movements on the whiteboard?</b></summary>

If your Root® Pro coding robot is moving slowly and making additional movements on a vertical magnetic whiteboard, it is likely because the robot is using its sensors and corrective algorithms to compensate for gravity and draw the most accurate shapes possible. 

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Why does my Root® coding robot slip when it drives?</b></summary>

Root® coding robots may slip more than usual if the wheels are dirty from dust or marker ink.
To improve performance, try cleaning the wheels with some rubbing alcohol and a cloth.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Why won’t my Root® coding robot draw well on a flat surface?</b></summary>

If your Root® coding robots won't draw on a flat surface, such as the fold-out whiteboard that is included in the box, please check the marker holder.
The robot's marker holder can hold several different brands of dry-erase markers and pens, but these tools come in a variety of different shapes and sizes.
This means that some pencils, crayons, and pens cannot be gripped by the robot’s marker holder or are not pushed down hard enough by the springs in the marker actuator.
The marker should be just above the drawing surface when the marker holder is in the up position.
When the marker holder is programmed to go down, the marker should go down below the wheel height.
If the Root® Pro coding robot detects a cliff, the robot will automatically lift the marker to prevent it from drawing when it is placed back down.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Why won’t my Root® Pro coding robot erase?</b></summary>

The Root® Pro coding robot's eraser is designed to work best on magnetic whiteboard surfaces.
The eraser has an embedded magnet to hold it firmly against the smooth surface of magnetic whiteboard so that it can erase.
On the included fold-up whiteboard, the robot will typically not be able to press down hard enough to erase effectively and the eraser pad can get caught on the folds, pushing the robot off course.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How do I clean the eraser pad on my Root Pro?</b></summary>

Root’s eraser pad is held in place with a hook-and-loop fastener.
To service, simply peel off the eraser pad, wash and dry it, and replace it on the robot.

</details>

### Features and Accessories

<details>
<summary><b>Is the Root Brick Top accessory compatible with my robot?</b></summary>

The Root Brick Top is compatible with both Root models and attaches magnetically to the top of the robot.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How does the Root® Pro coding robot stick to a magnetic vertical whiteboard?</b></summary>

The Root® Pro coding robot has strong permanent magnets embedded inside its chassis to help it climb whiteboards.
There are also twelve (12) smaller magnets on the top surface to connect accessories.
Keep magnetic-sensitive objects away from the robot.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How do I clean off dry-erase marker from my whiteboard?</b></summary>

Dry-erase marker should be able to be wiped off non-porous whiteboard surfaces using the included microfiber cloth.
We recommend wiping clean the whole whiteboard after every use.
If the marker ink is left to dry for longer periods of time, it may get harder to clean off.
For marks that do not wipe off easily, you can trying using a damp cloth.
For more stubborn marks, you can draw over them with a fresh dry-erase marker.
Once drawn over, you should be able to wipe it clean with a cloth.
Please note that the marker you use for cleaning will pick up some of the color you are drawing over, so use a matching color or darker marker to clean if possible.

<summary><b>How fast can Root® coding robots drive?</b></summary>

Root® coding robots can drive up to ****10 cm/s.**

<details>
<summary><b>Why do the wheels on my Root robot make a clicking sound?</b></summary>

Root’s drive wheels have internal clutches to prevent damage to the motors if Root is pushed or gets stuck.
The clicking sound is the clutch being activated when the there is too big of a force between the wheel and the motor.
If it keeps happening, make sure that nothing is blocking the wheel and preventing it from turning.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Why do the wheels stop when I pick the Root® Pro coding robot up?</b></summary>

The Root® Pro coding robot is designed to only drive on flat surfaces.
Its integrated cliff sensor allows the robot to detect when it is lifted.

<details>
<summary><b>Why does the color sensor turn off when I pick the Root® Pro coding robot up?</b></summary>

The Root® Pro coding robot only detects color when it's driving on a flat surface.
If too little light is refected back to the cliff sensor, the robot will turn off the color sensing.
You may cover the cliff sensor on the robot if you would like to see the color sensor run while picked up.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How do I calibrate the Root® Pro coding robot’s color sensor?</b></summary>

The Root® Pro coding robot will automatically calibrate to the reflectiveness of the surface underneath the robot.
We recommend that you leave the robot on a white surface for a few seconds before starting a color sensing program.

### Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><b>Why won’t my Root coding robot connect to my Android device?</b></summary>

Many connection issues on Android devices are caused by incorrect Bluetooth permissions.
In Android, Bluetooth permissions are often included under “Location permissions”.
On your device, confirm that:
1. app-level Location permissions are enabled for the SAM Root app
2. device-level Location permissions turned on
3. Bluetooth is turned on

To turn on app-level Location permissions for the SAM Root app, long press the app icon and open the “App info” screen. 
From there, select “Permissions” → “Location” → “Allow only while using the app”. The app should also have requested this permission the first time it is opened.

To turn on device-level Location permissions, open the “Settings” app and select “Location” → “Use location”

To turn on Bluetooth, swipe from the top of the screen to bring up the Quick Settings menu and tap the Bluetooth icon. Alternatively, open the “Settings” app and select “Connected devices” → “Connection preferences” → “Bluetooth” → “Use Bluetooth”.

<summary><b>My Root® robot keeps stopping, beeping, and blinking red. Help?</b></summary>

The robot will flash red and beep when (1) the battery level gets too low or (2) it detects that a wheel is stuck. If your robot still flashes red, beeps twice, and stops moving when it is fully charged, then the robot is likely triggering a stuck or “stalled” motor error. 
 
Some reasons this error can be triggered include:
1. **Something is blocking the wheel or robot.** This is the most common reason for a motor stall. Please make sure nothing is stuck around the wheels and that they can rotate normally.
2. **The motor connector is unplugged from the printed circuit board in the robot.** You can often tell this is the problem by manually rotating both wheels with your fingers while the robot is ON. Because the motor brakes are applied when the robot is ON, if the stalled wheel is easier to spin than the non-stalled wheel, it may just be unplugged.
3. **If there is an issue with the motor itself.** If the robot is OFF for 10 seconds — and therefore the motor brakes are OFF — and the stuck wheel is harder to rotate than the other wheel, then there may be an issue with the motor or gearbox.
4. **If the wheel encoder has broken (e.g. because of a fall from a significant height).** This may be the issue if both motors feel the same when manually rotating them but one wheel moves faster than the other (making more noise) before the robot beeps and flashes red.
 
If you believe that you are experiencing this issue, please contact us with the serial number from the bottom of the robot (or a photo of the label on the bottom) along with a copy of your purchase confirmation to verify the robot's warranty status. If you did not purchase directly from us, please reach out to the respective provider.

<summary><b>Why are the lights on my Root® coding robot flashing blue?</b></summary>

If your Root® coding robot is flashing blue with the eyes off, then the robot is in “update mode". This can happen if a firmware update is started but fails to complete successfully.

To troubleshoot this occurrence, connect to the robot from the SAM Root app. (The robot name will be "ROOT BOOT".)
Once connected, the app should prompt you to update.
Press the “Update” button and wait for the update to complete.

Please contact us with a summary of your experience if you are not able to update your robot.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Why is the light on the back of my Root® coding robot flashing red on its own?</b></summary>

The rear light on the Root® coding robot will flash red when the battery is getting low.
Please plug it in to charge using the provided charging cable.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Why is my Root® coding robot frozen or unresponsive?</b></summary>

If your Root® coding robot is frozen or unresponsive, try to hold the yellow button (its nose) for 10 seconds until the robot turns off.
Then, turn the robot back on by pressing the yellow button a second time.

If the robot flashes red, the robot needs charging.
If the robot flashes blue, the robot needs to complete a firmware update.
If the robot does not move when you code a program and press play, ensure that Bluetooth is enabled and working and that the SAM Root app is properly connected to that robot.
You will need to reconnect to the robot after it is reset.

If your robot is still misbehaving after being reset, please contact us for assistance.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Why does my Root® coding robot keep disconnecting on its own?</b></summary>

If the Bluetooth connection with your Root® coding robot keeps disconnectiong, try charging your robot and your device.
A low battery can cause connectivity problems.
If both devices have enough charge, ensure that you are running the latest version of the SAM Root app and that the firmware on your Root® coding robot is up to date.
